claim, one paragraph to support it

Culture does not determine who an individual is and how they should lead their life. Instead, one has the ability to shape it to fit their desires. The author draws a comparison between her brother and the successful Basketball player Jeremy Lin. Both ended up being very good athletes though they had completely different social and cultural backgrounds. Although her brother Bob struggled to gain his parents support in his athletics, he still pursued and succeeded in the area. His parents tried to push their own culture and values upon him but he resisted and shaped his own life.
